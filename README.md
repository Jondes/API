# API
API stands for “Application Programming Interface,” a method to communicate between different applications.

To render some data in our front end, we either need a backend to store our data and then make use of the data, or we can simply use APIs to have some mock data while building an application.

When we use APIs, we don’t need a backend and are also not required to build anything from scratch. Mostly, we use the REST API or the GraphQL API to access the data added to the server. Before we get into depth, we should understand how an API works.
